The Pewlett Hackard Employee Data Analysis Project encompasses the utilization of data engineering and analysis techniques on a dataset comprising six CSV files. These files contain comprehensive information about employees who were associated with the company during the 1980s and 1990s. The responsibilities of a newly appointed data engineer encompassed the formulation of table schemas to organize the data, the seamless integration of CSV files into a SQL database, and the execution of queries to facilitate data analysis. The successful importation of CSV files into the corresponding SQL tables is of utmost importance. This process must be executed meticulously, ensuring that the files are imported in the correct order. This is crucial due to the interdependencies that exist between the tables. The alignment of primary and foreign keys across tables is crucial in maintaining data integrity and preventing constraint violations. The repository includes multiple files that are relevant to data analysis. These files consist of CSV data files, an image file depicting the Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) generated during the data modeling process, and .sql files that encompass the table schemas and SQL queries. The SQL queries conducted an analysis on various aspects of employee data. This analysis included retrieving employee details, specifically focusing on hire dates for employees hired in the year 1986. Additionally, the queries obtained manager details for each department, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the organizational structure. Furthermore, the analysis involved gathering department details for each employee, providing insights into the specific departments in which employees are assigned. The queries also extracted information about employees named Hercules B, enabling a targeted examination of this particular subset of employees. Moreover, the analysis encompassed employee details within the Sales department, shedding light on the individuals working in this specific area. Furthermore, the queries extended to include employee details in both the Sales and Development departments, allowing for a comparison between these two departments. Lastly, the analysis involved performing a frequency count of employee last names, presenting the results in descending order to identify the most common last names among employees. The repository contains the ERD, table schemas, and SQL queries.
